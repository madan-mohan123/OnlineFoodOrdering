## Introduction to the Project:
- Online Food Ordering System is an application which will help restaurant and the customers directly. Now customers don’t need to go out anywhere to find best food items in their locality. They will get served on their doorsteps. They also get a very large variety of food that they do not find in a single restaurant after visiting there. They can also submit their honest reviews about restaurants, food product received and about the application to enhance their experience.
This will help restaurants in the management point of view, as the manager will be able to optimize the dishes according to the people’s reviews and will be able to see the records of each employees and orders. This application will also help the restaurants to do all functionalities in more accurately and faster way. It reduces manual works and improves the efficiency of restaurant.
- The online food ordering system gives restaurants the ability to increase sales and expand their business by giving customers the facility to order food online. The customer can see restaurant menu online and they can easily place order with a simple mouse click. Also, with a food menu online we can easily track the orders, maintain customer’s database and improve the food delivery service. The restaurants’ can even customize online restaurant menu and upload images easily. Having restaurant menu on internet, potential customers can easily access it and place order at their convenience.

## Problem Statement:

- The online food ordering system sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place order according to their choices. Also, the online customers can easily track their orders. The management maintains customer’s database, and improve food delivery service.
- This system also provides a feedback system in which user can rate the food items. Also, the proposed system can recommend hotels, food, based on the ratings given by the user, hotel staff will be informed for the improvements along with the quality. The payment can be made online or cash or pay-on-delivery system.

## Main Objective of the Project:

- The main objective of the Online Food Ordering System is to manage the details of Item Category, Customer, Food, Delivery Address, Order, Shopping Cart. Also, to provide great experience for online food ordering. It will show the reviews about the selected food item to the customer to help him/her to get best food according to his/her preferences. It will also help in managing the order information.

## Working Methodology:
It outlines how data will be collected and tools for collecting data. Model view controller (MVC) is software design for developing web applications. It consists three parts like
1. Model -The lowest level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data.
2. View-It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
3. Controller-Software code that controls the interaction between model and view.
MVC isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concern. Here controller receive all requests for the application and then work with model to prepare any data needed by the view. The view then uses the data prepared by the controller to generate a final presentable response. It can be understood with the following diagram.

In this project we made a web application for food ordering. There are different modules to perform the task related to restaurant like managing the customer details, food order detail and transaction details. It gives the ease of access of food ordering to any person at any place. There are at least 8-9 web pages that handles the application. We use the HTML, CSS, bootstraps, jQuery for front end and php and MySQL database for making it dynamic website.

## Hardware and Software Requirements:
- Hardware Requirements: -
•	RAM of 4GB or Higher
•	Hard disk of minimum 256GB
•	Processor – Pentium III 630MHz
- Software Requirements: -
•	Any Browser (Chrome, Mozilla, Safari)
•	Java script/jQuery
•	XAMPP1.0
•	OS – windows 7 or higher or Linux

## Limitations of the System Proposed:

•	One of the largest disadvantages to food delivery systems is the price. When the food is ordered for more than one person, the expense is typically equal to eating out at a nice restaurant every night.
•	For individuals who have a limited food budget, food delivery systems are often too expensive to make their benefits worth the cost.
•	Another disadvantage to food delivery systems is the menu choices. Most food delivery services have a limited number of meals that they offer for consumption.
•	Every few weeks or months the menu will change, but if you stick to the system for more than a few months the menu items will become repetitive. You also must eat the meals delivered for that week.
•	The food still has to be prepared before it can be consumed. Preparation is usually simple, but since the meals are frozen, they usually have to cook for over an hour.
•	If a hungry customer finds that the wait time is longer than expected or predicted, there is less of a chance of returning to purchase again, and a greater probability that the customer will call to locate the order.

## Contribution Summary:

To develop this project, we need two types of technologies front-end and Back-end. Front-end contains the outlook of any web page and Back-end makes pages dynamic in nature. Our Project divide into four modules where each module created by individual member.
	Mohan Agrawal: Related to account information like registration and authentication pages will be developed with this.
	Shivam Sharma:  It maintains the module related to restaurant details and their menu card of food available.
	Udit Aggarwal: Covers searching module that is necessary part of food ordering. It tells the end user of food available or not from particular restaurant.
	Madan Mohan: It maintains the transaction information of end users and view the details of customers.
 The Home page of web application will be developed with help of team members. As, we are team so we also help each other if there is any problem in different modules.

## Online Git Repository:

For maintaining the project schedules & meeting with team member, we created an online git Repository so that we done our project without facing any kind difficulty. There are some dates which specifies our team work.
30-Aug-2020: project synopsis submission
20-sep-2020: mid-term report & meeting with team
30-sep-2020: Design of Software and analysis
20-oct-2020: Coding process
30-oct-2020: Testing
15-nov-2020: Project report

## Conclusion:

The conclusion of the proposed system is based on user’s need and is user centred. The system is developed in considering all issues related to all user which are included in this system. Wide range of people can use this web application. Various issues related to Mess/Tiffin services will be solved by providing them a full-fledged system. Thus, implementation of Online Food Ordering System will be to help and solve one of the important problem of people.
With online food ordering system, a restaurant and mess menu can be set up online and the customers can easily place order. Also, with a food menu online, tracking the orders is done easily, it maintains customer’s database and improve the food delivery service. The restaurants and mess can even customize online restaurant menu and upload images easily. Having a restaurant menu on internet, potential customers can easily access it and place order at their convenience. Thus, an automated food ordering system will be proposed with features of feedback and wireless communication.
